Flare-On Challenge Write-Ups
----------------------------

This repository contains my write-ups for the [Flare-On
challenge](http://flare-on.com), a reverse-engineering challenge that [FireEye,
Inc.](https://www.fireeye.com/) puts on every year to scout talent for hiring.

Under the folder for a given year, each numbered folder contains a description,
including screenshots, of how I solved that challenge, as well as any relevant
solution code that I've written.  Feel free to email me with any questions,
corrections, or comments that you have.
